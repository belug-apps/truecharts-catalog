In-cluster web-based application that enables users with a one-time installation to deploy, manage, and upgrade 
applications on a Kubernetes cluster. Belug-apps is based on two project:

- <u>[vcluster](https://www.vcluster.com/)</u>, to isolate all applications from existing TrueCharts
- <u>[kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/)</u> for the web-base application. Belug-apps make this project compatible with
`TrueNAS Scale` with some extensions.

**CAUTIONS:**   
**- This application needs Traefik ingress and an SSL certificate to work properly**  
**- It has not been tested in multi-node mode**

_This TrueNAS charts **not** is supplied by TrueCharts nor ixsystems_
